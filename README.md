# Chatcloud

This is the code I have written to visualize the WhatsApp chat between two people as a Word Cloud. 

A wordcloud shows you the most frequent words of the corpus in a very appealing and fun way. 
For visualizing your own wordcloud, you just need two txt files, one of stopwords which I have provided and the other of your WhatsApp Chat which you can extract easily from the app. 

So, just change the name of the file in the code and have some fun!
